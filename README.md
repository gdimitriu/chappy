The transformation server was choose as type of long running server. The transformation server will take request using REST.

- Predefined service for transformation using staxon and saxon.
- hot-plugin of the transformation steps.

- HTTP upgrade service. (not implemented yet)

Chappy uses the following libraries and technologies:
